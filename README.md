# Multilingual-Speech-to-Text-and-Speech-to-Speech-Content-Summarization-for-Indian-Languages
This project presents a multilingual pipeline for both **speech-to-text** and **speech-to-speech summarization** in Indian languages. It transcribes audio using a fine-tuned Whisper ASR model, summarizes text with mT5, and optionally synthesizes the summary back into speech using Indic Parler-TTS.
